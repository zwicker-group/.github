We are a research group that is interested in understanding basic biological processes. We build and analyze theoretical models using tools from statistical physics, dynamical system theory, fluid dynamics, and information theory. You can [learn more about our work from our webpage](www.zwickergroup.org).


This page collects our open source software:
* [`py-pde`](https://github.com/zwicker-group/py-pde) for solving partial differential equations
* [`py-droplets`](https://github.com/zwicker-group/py-droplets) for analyzing and representing droplets
* [`MathematicaToPython`](https://github.com/zwicker-group/MathematicaToPython) for converting Mathematica expressions to python code
* [`tutorial-pattern-formation-in-cells`](https://github.com/zwicker-group/tutorial-pattern-formation-in-cells) a tutorial we developed for a winter school
