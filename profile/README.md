# "Theory of Biological Fluids" group

We are a research group that is interested in understanding basic biological processes. We build and analyze theoretical models using tools from statistical physics, dynamical system theory, fluid dynamics, and information theory. This page collects some of our work and tools, so other researchers can build on this.
